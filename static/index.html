            <h2>Currently</h2>
            <p>
              I work at Radial as a Full Stack Software and Clinical Engineer
              II, building healthcare technology solutions that keep pace with
              evolving industry needs. I started as a self-taught engineer and
              have rapidly progressed through technical levels, developing
              products that serve healthcare providers across 12+ hospitals.
            </p>

            <p>
              Currently, we are expanding our platform and API capabilities
              while actively developing new products and workflows to support
              the upcoming CMS TEAM model (Transforming Episode Accountability
              Model) launching January 2026. This work leverages our partnership
              with Bamboo Health and their Pings product to create care
              coordination solutions for episode-based payment models. My
              clinical background as an actively licensed physical therapist
              allows me to bridge the technical requirements with real-world
              clinical workflows, ensuring our solutions address both regulatory
              compliance and practical implementation challenges.
